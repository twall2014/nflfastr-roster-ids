# nflfastr-roster-ids
This is essentially a version of roster.csv from https://github.com/guga31bb/nflfastR-data/tree/master/roster-data/roster.csv that contains an additional column (nflfastr_ids) that contains the new nflfastR player ID mappings.
Players that don't have a 'new' nflfastR ID will have their GSIS ID in that column.
